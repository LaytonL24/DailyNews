# The Daily News

A responsive, multi-layout news landing page that adapts its visual identity based on device size. This project showcases advanced CSS techniques including Flexbox, Media Queries, and conditional content rendering.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for three distinct breakpoints:
    * **Desktop:** Multi-column grid with full article previews.
    * **Tablet:** Streamlined view hiding secondary navigation and condensing the sidebar.
    * **Mobile:** Vertical stack with modern gradients, hidden non-essential stories, and a "Modern UI" font stack.
* **Semantic HTML5:** Built with accessibility and SEO in mind using `article`, `section`, `nav`, and `main` tags.
