                    <h2>Trump's been talking about Greenland. Why?</h2>
                    <p>Greenland is a large island that sits between Canada, Europe and Russia. It's part of the Arctic Circle, 
                        which is why most of the island is covered by a massive sheet of ice. Greenland also has natural resources 
                        like oil, gas and critical minerals that are mostly untapped. Taking over Greenland is important for national 
                        security, according to Trump. The island is in a key strategic position for the U.S. because it can provide 
                        early defence for potential attacks coming in from Russia. It's a good place for radar, military bases and 
                        missile defence systems, and Trump has said he needs Greenland because Russia and China want to take it over. </p>

                    <h2>Ontario had an earthquake. Did you know Canada has 4,000 a year?</h2>
                    <p>Thousands of Ontarians felt the ground shake beneath their feet this week. Just before 11 p.m. ET on Jan. 27, 
                        Earthquakes Canada recorded a magnitude 3.7 quake in central and Southern Ontario. It was felt from 
                        Kingston all the way to Kitchener, according to Natural Resources Canada. So far there haven't been any 
                        reports of injuries or damage. A 3.7-magnitude earthquake is considered weak, and it's very unlikely for 
                        those under a magnitude of five to cause damage. </p>

                        10 years ago picking up objects and using them to scratch parts of her body.</p>

                    <h2>Careful! Many Pizza Pops products currently unsafe to eat</h2>
                    <p class="first-sentence">This week, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) added several more flavours of 
                        Pizza Pops to a previous recall that began on Dec. 21, 2025.</p>
                    <p class="extra-sentences"> The recall is due to the possible contamination 
                        from a dangerous bacteria called E. coli that can make you sick. Last month, several people were hospitalized 
                        after the first recall.</p>

                    <h2>Which city got the most snowfall? And where does it all go?</h2>
                    <p class="first-sentence">Were you one of the thousands of Canadians enjoying the snowfall this week? Whether you 
                        love it or loathe it, much of the country got lots of snow.</p>
                    <p class="extra-sentences">John Pomeroy, a professor of geography studies how the snow affects the environment. Snow recharges soil with moisture and often 
                        replenishes nearby lakes, rivers and streams. That process is great for our water systems, said Pomeroy. </p>

                        one, but two (golden) Academy Awards, or Oscars. The film scored nominations for best animated feature and 
                        best original song for Golden. Fans of the film will have to wait until March 15 to see if these

                    <h2>Why many Canadians saw dazzling northern lights this week</h2>
                    <p>An impressive solar storm could be seen from parts of Northern Canada this week. Solar storms are caused by flares of 
                        energy travelling from the sun's surface into space. When this energy makes contact with Earth, it creates a phenomenon 
                        known as the northern lights. The scientific name is aurora borealis.</p>
